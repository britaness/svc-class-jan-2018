    <h1>Cats are superior</h1>
    <div class="bigIdea">
    <h3>Let me tell you why</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They don't take shit</li>
        <li>They purr</li>
        <li>They are hella cute</li>

    <p>Did you know that more people own cats than dogs? I don’t believe that is a mere accident. In the US, 95.6 Million people own cats compared to the 83.3 million who own dogs (“Pets by the Numbers”). 12.3 million more people own cats than dogs. According to this study, 15% more people own cats than dogs. Even though both pets are known to relieve stress, promote a positive outlook and lifestyle, and give the owner happiness, America still prefers cats (Wall Triana Animal Hospital; Couch). There are a few reasons why cats are preferred over dogs in the United States. In my opinion, cats are the superior pet over dogs by population because cats cost less money than dogs to keep, they don't require much work for their upkeep, do not depend on the owner as much as dogs tend to, and are typically healthier and have a longer life expectancy.</p>
